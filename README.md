Before conducting the code we need to understand the rules of the game.
<ol>
    <li>
      <p>In blackjack, each player and dealer receives two cards.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The player can then choose to ‚Äúplay‚Äù (request another card) or ‚Äústop‚Äù (keep on hold until a new request is made). The goal in this game is to keep the sum of all card points equal to 21 without exceeding it.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Face cards (i.e. Jack, Queen, and King) are worth 10 points, and Aces can be worth 11 points. If a player has more than 21 points then the player automatically loses the game.</p></li>
